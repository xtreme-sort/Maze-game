So, I used to play maze games in my childhood \
I was curious on how they actually create a maze \
So, I explored a little on how are these mazes created and i thought why not let's just make a game \
I wanted to make it unique, something i haven't seen before \
So, I decided let the player decide the starting point and then dive into solving the maze \
So, that is what my game is, give it a try!!! 


HOW TO PLAY:
1) Run the code
2) Select the starting point
3) Help the Green dot meet it's friend Red dot
