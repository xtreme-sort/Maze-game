So, I used to play maze games in my childhood
I was curious on how they actually create a maze
So, I explored a little on how are these mazes created and i thoughy why not let's just make a game
I wanted to make it unique, something i haven't seen before
So, I decided let the player decide the starting point and then dive into solving the maze
So, that is what my game is, give it a try!!!
